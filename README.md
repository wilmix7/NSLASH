# NSLASH

Introduction:
--------------
NSLASH    is    a    multilanguage    support   and    it  is   mainly   used    with   JAVA(JDk1.6 only)   Technology
NSLASH  Technology  is  invented  in   Jdollar  and   C@  Technology  in  April 2015.
NSLASH  is    the  Advanced   technology  with  VVMC chained  Framework.
NSLASH   Uses  WcatServer  to   run   .Nslash  Programs. .Nslash  supports  three  inputs 
which   are  .Nslash   with   C Programs  ,  .NSlash  with  Jdollar  oops  ,  .Nslash  with  Model  and  Controller
Programs. .Nslash  uses  VVMC->VVMC/... (View with Model/view/Controller  with   View with Model/view/Controller
....). with  Chaining  support and  it  generates   .Class  file  so that   it   can
interact   with   java  and   Multilanguages   of  WSIT  technologies   ,  Andriod with  JSaucer ,
and  C/C++  technologies. So NSLASH   is  a  VVMC/ Chained  Framework  technology  and  Advanced  Technology
like   JSAUCER  and  JDollar.


Syntax  of   NSLASH  with  C  Code.(view)
----------------------------------

<NSLASH>

<%

/*  C  code  */

%>

</NSLASH>

Note:  This   Syntax   will  Generate   an  Object   .O  file
-----
and   .class  file.

SYNTAX  of  NSLASH  with   VMC/
-------------------------------

<NSLASH>

<Convert>  or  <METHOD>
<%   

OOPS  code   like  Jdollar  

%>

<LIB>

</NSLASH>

Note:
----

When   we  use  Method    means  it  will  acts  like  a  Model.

Model  encapsulates  Bussiness  logic  and  Database  connections.

But  here  we  had  to  use   WXML.

We  already   Know  that   WXML  Generates   HTML  code   as  

Quick  as  Possible.  It   is  an  user  Friendly.

But   When   you  use   <Convert>  like   a   View

when  You   call   another  VVMC/  of  .Nslash  program  

it  will  act   as  a  Controller. This   Syntax  will  also   Generate  

.class  file.


Advantages:
----------

a)  Mostly   Used   in  Software  Developement,  JAVA(Jdk1.6) technolgy,Mobile,  and  Cloud  Computing.

b)  NSLASH  generates   the  combined  output  of  C Program  and

OOPS  Program. (combinations   of  two outputs)

c)  IT  also  Interacts  with  WXML  and  Behaves  like  UserFriedly  Framework.
ie)  We  can Design  a  HTML  Form , TABLE, REPORTS  ,etc  in  few  minutes.

d)  It  is  mainly  used  in  complexity  Programs  and  Projects  with  JAVA(Jdk1.6),Android,
and  WSIT  Technologies  (Multilangauage  support).

e) It  also  includes  the  Advantages  of  C@.

f)  One  Must   Know   JDOLLAR,  JAVA(Jdk1.6), C@ ,WXML  to  focus  this  Technology.
